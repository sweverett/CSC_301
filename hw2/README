Follow below steps for Homework 2:

1. There are 4 methods you will need to implement in BinarySearchTree.java

2. I will be releasing a JUnit test file which will include 5 performance tests:
   i) Random insertion efficiency for LinkedList
   ii) In order insertion efficiency for SortedArray
   iii) Search efficiency for SortedArray
   iv) Random insertion efficiency for BST
   v) Search efficiency for BST
   
   along with 5 tests for BST implementation:
   i) size
   ii) insert
   iii) delete
   iv) getClosestEntry
   v) dictionaryST
   
3. Make sure that your code passes all the tests in this test file.

4. Commit and push your code into Bitbucket and verify your submission 
   by checking the online repository.

If you have any questions, send them to the emailing list.
    
Good Luck!
