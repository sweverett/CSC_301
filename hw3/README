Follow below steps for Homework 3:

1. There are 5 methods you will need to implement in LLRB.java,
   along with 2 bonus methods

2. I will be releasing a JUnit test file which will include tests
   for the below 5 methods:
   i) insert --- insert a key and fix the left-leaning red-black tree
   ii) containsRightRedEdge --- check whether the tree has at least
                                one right red edge
   iii) containsConsecutiveLeftRedEdges --- check whether the tree has at least
                                            two left red edges in a row
   iv) countBlackEdgesOnLeftmostPath --- count the number of black edges
                                         on the leftmost path
   v) sameBlackEdgesCountOnAllPaths(int count) --- check whether every path from root
                                                   to a leaf has "count" many black edges
   
   along with 2 tests for the bonus methods:
   i) merge(LLRB llrb) --- insert all of the the keys of the given "llrb"
   ii) fixLLRB --- given a tree satisfying the same black edges count invariant,
                   fix its red edges so that it becomes a valid LLRB.
                   permitted operations are: rotateRight, rotateLeft, flipColors.

3. Make sure that your code passes all the tests in this test file.

4. Commit and push your code into Bitbucket and verify your submission 
   by checking the online repository.

If you have any questions, post them on Piazza.
    
Good Luck!
