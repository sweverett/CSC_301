There are 10 test cases in total. Passing each test case is worth 5 points.
If you fail a test you may still get points depending on your code.

The test cases cover in order insertions and deletions, in reverse insertions
and deletion, and random insertions and deletions. It also covers throwing
exceptions.

You can run the test cases by Running the HW1Test.java file. It should print
some output to the console to help you, and to focus on the problem tests, you
can comment/uncomment tests as you like. You can also modify tests for further
debugging. However, you will be tested on the original testing setup.

NOTE: In DictionaryST, get and contains methods have errors. They won't be
updated but the corrections are below:

	public boolean contains(String word) {
		Entry e = dict.getClosestEntry(word);
		return (word == e.word);
	}

should read

	public boolean contains(String word) {
		Entry e = dict.getClosestEntry(word);
		return (e != null && word == e.word);
	}
 
AND

	public String[] get(String word) {
		Entry e = dict.getClosestEntry(word);
		if (word == e.word) {
			return e.defns;
		} else {
			return null;
		}
	}

should read

	public String[] get(String word) {
		Entry e = dict.getClosestEntry(word);
		if (e != null && word == e.word) {
			return e.defns;
		} else {
			return null;
		}
	}
